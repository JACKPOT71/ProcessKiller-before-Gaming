🎮 ProcessKiller Before Gaming by JACKPOT_ZB

ProcessKiller Before Gaming is a Windows command-line tool designed to maximize gaming performance by reducing background system load. 
It temporarily disables unnecessary processes, services, and CPU power-saving states to achieve lower latency, faster response times, 
and increased system stability during gaming sessions.

⚙️ Features
🔻 [1] DISABLE ALL

Terminates unnecessary background processes, including Explorer, idle processes, and Nvidia container tasks — all in one command.

🔺 [2] ENABLE ALL

Restores everything disabled by the tool: reopens Explorer, Nvidia containers, and re-enables idle CPU states.

🗂️ [3] Close Explorer

Closes Windows Explorer to free up memory and reduce DWM-related latency.

🗂️ [4] Open Explorer

Restarts Windows Explorer after you're done gaming or if needed.

🎮 [5] Disable Nvidia Container

Temporarily stops Nvidia Container processes, which may consume background CPU usage unnecessarily.

💡 [6] Enable Nvidia Container

Restarts Nvidia Container processes.

🚫 [7] Disable CPU Idle States (C-States)

Disables CPU idle states (C1/C3/C6 etc.) for ultra-low latency and a more responsive system.
⚠️ Warning: This may increase CPU temperatures.

✅ [8] Enable CPU Idle States

Restores the default CPU power-saving behavior to reduce heat and power consumption.

🛠️ Requirements
Windows 10/11

Must be run as Administrator

🚨 Disclaimer
This tool makes low-level changes to your system behavior.

Do not use if you are unsure what the options do.

Always monitor CPU temps when disabling C-States.

You use this software at your own risk.

📎 Notes
Changes to IMOD or CPU states are not persistent and will reset after a reboot.

No obfuscation is used, so users can review .ps1 or .bat scripts if needed.

Source code currently unavailable, pending script cleanup.
